- print in black and white option, removes color from the final pdf and only has the color codes
- make the layout of the final print more aesthetically pleasing. thumbnail of original image appears on the printout.
- trouble shoot printer setting, provide suggestions for getting it to print at the correct size
- contact information for receiving feedback to help improve site
- figure out how to process larger files. find a plug-in.
- cropping feature, or refer user to another site to create crop
- support patterns up to six tiles large, or is it possible to make this so modular that there are no size constraints?
- panoramic formats? or restrict to 1x1 and 2x3?
- refine color matching algorithm. make it more accurate and more efficient. test it against images of pixel art. is it grabbing appropriate colors? it is averaging out sections incorrectly? is it finding the appropriate places to mix colors? how do other image processing algorithms do this?
- are the RBG values I’ve loaded for the beads actually accurate reflections of the bead colors?
- what is the best fit format to export in? png? pdf?
- support multiple pages for multiple tiles. list should only print out once. tiles should be labeled with position. dotted line for cut out?
- feature that allows user to define color palette, add and remove beads. check boxes? predefined sets? what are the standard perler sets?
- other approaches for color theory? van gogh setting? arbitrary color? how to interpret things wildly.
- grayscale setting. only uses neutral beads.
- terminology, are these murals? pegboards? how do people talk about these things online? at perler? 
- will this website work on a smartphone?
- what are the actual color codes used by Perler?
- feature to increase contrast in starting photo? or manipulate the pixels in a way that the final template will be better? what’s the best route to success?
- state explicitly which beads are not used in the program - glow in the dark, striped, glitter, etc.
- allow user to manually correct beads at output?
- do the colors of the surrounding pixels in any way affect what color should be chosen to represent the given pixel?
