### Repository Description

This repository contains my Capstone Project for the Software Development certificate program at Southwest Technical College. This project is the culmination of what I've learned over the past year in my Java progamming classes. I designed an all-in-one software to help manage the day to day operations of a floral shop. It features a GUI built in JavaFX, and allows the user to manage inventory, keep a database of customer, complete sales transactions, and schedule deliveries.
